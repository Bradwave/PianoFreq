## PianoFreq

### A piano tuning application for educational purposes

This is a JS web app, available at [bradwave.github.io/PianoFreq](https://bradwave.github.io/PianoFreq).

It can be used as an educational tool for explaining _**musical temperament**_.

The horizontal line represents the frequency spectrum spanning an _**octave**_ from _f_ to _2f_. Keys can be moved around and tuned accordingly to their position on the frequency line. They can also be played by clicking on them or via the computer keyboard by pressing the corresponding key.

Graphics and sound are handled with [p5.js](https://p5js.org/) and [Tone.js](https://tonejs.github.io/) respectively.

### Context

This software is part of a project for the course _Matematiche Elementari dal Punto di Vista Superiore_ ("Elementary Mathematics from the Superior Point of View") from the _Master Degree in Mathematics_ of the _University of Turin_, Italy.
