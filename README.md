### The Klein interpretation of irrational number approximation with continued fractions

This is a very simple web-based JavaScript application, available at [bradwave.github.io/KleinInt](https://bradwave.github.io/KleinInt).

It is an interactive version of the _**Klein**_ geometrical interpretation of the _**approximation**_ of _**irrational numbers**_ with _**continued fractions**_, in the case of square roots.\
The user can dynamically change the value of the square root.

The line _y=√m∙x_ is represented on the Cartesian plane. _√m_ is calculated as a continued fraction and its _**convergents**_ _p/q_ are represented as points of coordinates _(q, p)_ in red for those of even indexes, blue otherwise. Points of the same color are then joint with lines that tend to get closer to _y=√m∙x_ as the convergents better approximate the square root.

The user can also move in the Cartesian plane by dragging to translate or scrolling to adjust the zoom level.

This software is part of a project for the course _Matematiche Elementari dal Punto di Vista Superiore_ ("Elementary Mathematics from the Superior Point of View") from the _Master Degree in Mathematics_ of the _University of Turin_, Italy.
